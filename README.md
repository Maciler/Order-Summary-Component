### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
    <div class="d-flex vh-100">
        <div class="d-flex w-100 justify-content-center align-self-center">
          center content vertically and horizontally
        </div>
    </div>
```



### Continued development

- I will keep focusing on css alignment and styling without libraries like bootstrap.

### Useful resources

- [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for css styling. 
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This is an amazing site which helped me finally understand css flexbox alignments. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
